# ES6 Features Repository

Welcome to the ES6 Features Repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of the main elements introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

## Overview

ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, brought significant improvements and new features to JavaScript. This repository aims to provide an organized and easy-to-understand overview of these features, complete with examples and explanations.

## Introduction

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced numerous features and syntactical improvements that made JavaScript more powerful and easier to work with. These features include block-scoped variables (`let`, `const`), arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignment, default parameters, rest and spread operators, classes, promises, and modules. This repository serves as a reference to explore each of these features with clear examples and explanations.

## Block-Scoped Variables and Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced two new ways to declare variables: `let` and `const`, which provide block scope. Arrow functions offer a shorter syntax and lexically bind the `this` value.

## Template Literals

Template literals allow for easier string interpolation and multi-line strings.

## Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring allows for the extraction of values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

## Default Parameters

Default parameters enable function parameters to have default values.

## Rest and Spread Operators

The rest operator (`...`) allows for the representation of an indefinite number of arguments as an array, while the spread operator expands an array into individual elements.

## Classes

ES6 classes provide a simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and handle inheritance.

## Promises

Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more gracefully.

## Modules

ES6 modules allow for the import and export of functionalities between different JavaScript files.

## Examples
